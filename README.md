# ENAUTO DNA Center Demo

The purpose of this repository is to provide a starting point for your exploration into the DNA Center APIs.  Postman is a great way to get familiar with APIs in general, but in this demo we will focus on using Python and the `requests` library.  Please feel free to explore using any additional means.

## Reference Class
The `cisco-dnacenter` folder in this repository is a git submodule that points to a repository I biuld as I studied for the ENAUTO test.  You can use this as reference for building your own helper functions.

## Documentation
The first step in learning any API is figuring out where to find the documntation.  The DNA Center APIs can be found on-box by navigating to **Platform**->**Developer Toolkit**->**APIs**.

**Example:** https://{{your_dna_center}}/dna/platform/app/consumer-portal/developer-toolkit/apis

The second place to find documentation about the DNA Center APIs is the DevNet Website. Navigate to https://developer.cisco.com -> **Technologies** -> **Networking** -> **Cisco DNA Center Platform**.

There is a lot of great information about APIs on this site.  Here is a direct link [DNA Center APIs on DevNet](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/dna-center/#!cisco-dna-center-platform-overview/intent-apis)

It's a good idea to read through the API documenation.
